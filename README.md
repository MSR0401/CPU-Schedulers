# CPU-Schedulers
•Constructed the primary operating system scheduling algorithms, First Come First Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), Priority Round Robin, and Round Robin (RR)in C programming language. \n
•Turnaround, waiting, and response times for each scheduling algorithm were computed and compared, offering a data-driven method to comprehend and enhance scheduler performance.
